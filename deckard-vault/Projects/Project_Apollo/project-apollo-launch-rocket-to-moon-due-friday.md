# Project Apollo — Launch rocket to the moon (due Friday)

> Project to complete by Friday: prepare and execute a rocket launch mission to the moon. Includes key workstreams (vehicle readiness, mission plan, launch operations, safety/compliance, and comms) and a task checklist.

## Goal
- Launch a rocket to the moon by **Friday**.

## Outcome / Definition of Done
- Rocket successfully launches and is on a validated trajectory toward the moon.
- Mission plan approved, launch criteria met, and post-launch confirmation completed.

## Key workstreams
- Vehicle & payload readiness ([[Rocket Systems]], [[Payload Integration]])
- Mission design & navigation ([[Mission Planning]], [[Trajectory Design]])
- Launch operations ([[Launch Operations]], [[Launch Checklist]])
- Safety, range, and regulatory approvals ([[Range Safety]], [[Compliance]])
- Communications & tracking ([[Telemetry]], [[Ground Station Network]])

## Task checklist
### Planning & approvals
- [ ] Confirm exact Friday deadline/time window and launch site constraints
- [ ] Finalize mission requirements (payload mass, target orbit/transfer, success criteria)
- [ ] Complete risk review and go/no-go criteria
- [ ] Secure range approval and required permits

### Engineering & integration
- [ ] Verify rocket build/configuration freeze
- [ ] Complete payload integration and fit checks
- [ ] Validate avionics, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) configuration
- [ ] Run end-to-end comms/telemetry test
- [ ] Confirm fueling plan, consumables, and ground support equipment readiness

### Testing & rehearsal
- [ ] Conduct full systems test (hardware + software)
- [ ] Perform countdown rehearsal / wet dress rehearsal
- [ ] Validate abort modes and contingency procedures

### Launch execution
- [ ] Execute launch countdown per [[Launch Checklist]]
- [ ] Go/No-Go poll and final weather/range check
- [ ] Launch
- [ ] Confirm stage events and insertion/transfer conditions

### Post-launch
- [ ] Verify initial trajectory and tracking lock
- [ ] Capture anomalies/issues and open follow-up actions
- [ ] Produce brief mission report for stakeholders

## Key decisions / unknowns
- Launch window specifics (time, duration, constraints)
- Vehicle type and propulsion details
- Payload details and lunar mission profile (flyby, impactor, orbit insertion)
