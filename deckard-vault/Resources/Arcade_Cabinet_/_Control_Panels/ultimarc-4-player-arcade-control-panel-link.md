# Ultimarc 4-Player Arcade Control Panel (Link)

> Saved reference link to Ultimarc’s 4-player arcade control panel product page for use in arcade cabinet/controls planning and parts comparison.

## Link
- Product page: https://www.ultimarc.com/arcade-control-panel/

## What this is
- A pre-made (or configurable) [[Arcade Control Panel]] option designed for **4-player** setups.
- Useful as a reference for:
  - Control panel layout ideas
  - Parts sourcing / BOM comparison
  - Pricing and dimensions when planning a [[4-Player Arcade Cabinet]]

## Notes / Questions to answer later
- [ ] Does the panel support the preferred joystick/button standards (e.g., Sanwa / Happ style)?
- [ ] What encoder/interface options are offered (USB, I-PAC, etc.) and do they match the target platform ([[PC]]/[[Raspberry Pi]]/[[MiSTer]])?
- [ ] Confirm dimensions and mounting requirements vs current cabinet plan.
- [ ] Check availability/shipping to your location.
