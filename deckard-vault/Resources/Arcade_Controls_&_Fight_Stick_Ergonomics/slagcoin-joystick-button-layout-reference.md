# Slagcoin: Joystick/Button Layout Reference (Arcade Fight Sticks)

> Reference link to Slagcoin’s classic guide on arcade joystick/button layouts, commonly used when choosing or drilling fight stick panels. Includes a checklist of what to compare across layouts (comfort, wrist angle, button reach, game type) and pointers to document your chosen standard (e.g., Vewlix/Sega/Noir-style layouts).

> [!INFO] What this is
> This page is widely referenced in the [[Fight Stick]] / [[Arcade Controller]] community for comparing common [[Arcade Button Layouts]] and understanding how placement affects comfort and performance.

## Why it matters
- Your chosen layout influences:
  - Finger travel and consistency for 6/8-button games
  - Wrist/forearm angle and long-session comfort
  - Ease of moving between cabinets/sticks (muscle memory)

## Layout comparison checklist (use while reading)
- **Row curvature**: straight vs arced rows; how it matches your hand’s natural arc
- **Primary 6 buttons**: spacing and reach for index–ring–pinky
- **Optional 7/8 buttons**: accessibility without accidental presses
- **Panel angle**: how the layout feels on different case sizes/heights
- **Game fit**:
  - [[Street Fighter]]-style 6-button
  - [[Guilty Gear]] / [[Anime Fighters]]
  - [[Marvel vs Capcom]] / 4-button-focused games

## Notes to capture from the page
- The named layout standards shown (e.g., common Japanese arcade panel standards)
- Any measurements/spacing guidance (center-to-center distances)
- Pros/cons described for each layout
- Recommendations for:
  - hand size considerations
  - joystick-to-button spacing
  - 6 vs 8 button positioning

## Practical decision workflow
- Choose your target standard layout (to match the cabinets you play on most).
- Validate with a paper template:
  - Print at 1:1 scale, tape to a flat surface
  - Rest your hand in neutral position and check reach
- If drilling/modding a panel, commit only after a template test.

- [ ] Decide on a default personal standard (e.g., “use X layout for all builds”).
