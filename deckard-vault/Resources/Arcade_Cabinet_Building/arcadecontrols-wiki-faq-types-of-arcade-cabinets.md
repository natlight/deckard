# ArcadeControls Wiki FAQ — Types of Arcade Cabinets (link)

> Reference link to the ArcadeControls Wiki FAQ section on types of arcade cabinets; saved for later review and extraction into build decisions.

## Source
- https://wiki.arcadecontrols.com/index.php/FAQ#Types_of_cabs

> [!WARNING] Content not ingested
> I can’t access the page contents from the link alone in this chat. If you paste the relevant section (or the full FAQ text), I can summarize the cabinet types, pros/cons, and turn it into decision notes for a build.

## Intended use
- Compare common [[Arcade Cabinet]] form factors for a potential [[MAME Cabinet]] or [[Home Arcade]] build.

## Questions to answer after reading
- What cabinet types are covered (e.g., upright, cocktail, bartop, cabaret, pedestal, sit-down/racer)?
- Typical dimensions and ergonomics (player height, control panel angle, monitor size/orientation).
- Use cases: classic arcade feel vs. space-saving vs. multiplayer.
- Build complexity and cost drivers (materials, monitor mounting, control panel layout).
- Compatibility considerations: [[CRT]] vs. [[LCD]], horizontal vs. vertical games, [[JAMMA]] wiring vs. PC.

## Next actions
- [ ] Open the link and skim the “Types of cabs” section.
- [ ] Paste the cabinet-type list and any pros/cons tables here for summarization.
- [ ] Decide on a target form factor and create a project note: [[Build Arcade Cabinet]].
