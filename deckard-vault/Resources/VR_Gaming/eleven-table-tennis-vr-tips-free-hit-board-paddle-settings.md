# Eleven Table Tennis VR: Practice & Equipment/Settings Tips (Free Hit Board, Paddle Sides, Paddle Position)

> Notes from a YouTube video covering practical tips for Eleven Table Tennis (VR): using the Free Hit Board to measure spin/speed, customizing red vs black paddle-side properties, adjusting paddle position/presets (including 3D-printed adapters), and flipping the paddle instead of rotating the controller.

## Tip 1 — Use the Free Hit Board for feedback (spin/speed/direction)
When not in single-player or multiplayer, you’re in “Free Hit” mode with a board that shows:
- Spin (revolutions per second)
- Ball speed
- Spin axis/direction (e.g., to your right vs left)

Use it to:
- Compare different serve motions and see which generates the most spin.
- Understand how racket path affects spin direction.

> Pick 2–3 serve variations and record the spin/speed numbers you consistently achieve. Optimize for a repeatable motion rather than one-off max values.

## Tip 2 — Customize red vs black paddle-side properties
In real table tennis, different rubbers can behave differently; in-game you can mimic this by changing paddle-side settings.

Where to change:
- Settings → Paddle → **Custom** → **Edit preset**

What you can adjust per side (red/black):
- **Bounciness**
- **Spin**
- **Throw coefficient**

Practical takeaways:
- You can tune one side for a “spin game” and the other for a “speed game.”
- If you want both sides to play the same, set both sides to identical values and save.

## Tip 3 — Set your paddle position / choose a paddle preset (adapter support)
If you use a physical adapter (e.g., 3D printed paddle handle), select/adjust the paddle position so the virtual paddle matches your grip.

Where:
- Custom → Presets → **Paddle position**

Notes:
- There are presets for various paddles/adapters you can buy or print.
- If your specific adapter isn’t listed, set it to **None** and manually adjust the position.

> [!INFO] Hardware note
> The creator uses a 3D printed paddle adapter. They mention a commercial option is ~US$20 (e.g., Amazon), otherwise print if you have access to a 3D printer.

## Tip 4 — Flip the paddle (don’t rotate the controller)
Instead of rotating your racket/handle in your hand to switch red/black sides, you can flip the paddle in-game.

Why this helps:
- Some controllers (e.g., older Quest controllers with large tracking rings) can be awkward when physically flipped/rotated mid-play.
- Flipping the paddle avoids grip issues and accidental interference.

## Actionable next steps (optional)
- [ ] In Free Hit, test 5 serve motions and note spin/speed ranges.
- [ ] Decide whether you want different red/black behaviors (spin vs speed) and save a preset.
- [ ] If using an adapter, calibrate paddle position until contact point feels natural.
