# Learn to Sew Sweatpants (Project Plan)

> A step-by-step project plan to learn how to sew sweatpants, including materials, skills to practice, milestone tasks, fitting notes, and a section to link related sewing notes in your vault.

## Goal & definition of done
- Sew a wearable pair of sweatpants that fit comfortably, with:
  - elastic waistband (with optional drawstring)
  - finished hems
  - at least 1 pocket option (optional)
  - seams that withstand stretching and washing

## Materials & tools checklist
- [ ] Pattern: commercial sweatpants pattern **or** traced pair of existing pants
- [ ] Fabric (knit): French terry / sweatshirt fleece / jersey (prewash)
- [ ] Rib knit for cuffs (optional)
- [ ] Elastic (waist): appropriate width for pattern (often 1–2 in / 2.5–5 cm)
- [ ] Drawstring + eyelets/grommets (optional)
- [ ] Thread (poly recommended)
- [ ] Needle: ballpoint or stretch needle
- [ ] Cutting tools: rotary cutter + mat or fabric shears
- [ ] Clips/pins suitable for knits
- [ ] Measuring tape + ruler
- [ ] Iron + pressing surface
- [ ] Serger (optional) or zigzag/stretch stitch on sewing machine

## Skills to learn/practice
- Identifying fabric stretch direction and choosing size accordingly
- Sewing stretch seams (zigzag/lightning stitch/serger)
- Differential feed basics (if using serger)
- Waistband construction (elastic casing or enclosed elastic)
- Hemming knits (twin needle, coverstitch, zigzag, or cuff)
- Basic pant fitting adjustments (rise, seat, crotch curve, inseam length)

## Milestones & tasks
### 1) Choose pattern and size
- [ ] Decide: use a commercial pattern or copy an existing pair
- [ ] Take measurements: waist, high hip, full hip, rise, inseam
- [ ] Choose size based on hip (then adjust waist with elastic)
- [ ] Decide options: cuffs vs hem, pockets yes/no, drawstring yes/no

### 2) Fabric plan & prep
- [ ] Pick fabric type and weight (note intended use: lounging vs outdoors)
- [ ] Prewash and dry fabric the way you’ll launder finished pants
- [ ] Square the fabric and check stretch recovery

> [!WARNING] Prewash reminder
> Knits can shrink; skipping prewash often leads to sweatpants that shorten or tighten after the first wash.

### 3) Make a quick test (recommended)
- [ ] Sew a mini “stretch seam sampler” with your chosen stitch settings
- [ ] Tug test seams for popped stitches
- [ ] Adjust stitch length/width and tension as needed

### 4) Cut and mark
- [ ] Layout pattern with grain/stretch direction correct
- [ ] Cut pieces (front/back legs, waistband/casing pieces, cuffs if any)
- [ ] Transfer markings: notches, pocket placement, center front/back

### 5) Sew main construction
- [ ] Sew pockets (if included) before closing side seams
- [ ] Sew front rise seam
- [ ] Sew back rise seam
- [ ] Join legs at crotch (sew inseam curve)
- [ ] Sew inner leg seams
- [ ] Sew side seams (if not already used for pockets)

### 6) Fit check
- [ ] Try on (baste if needed)
- [ ] Check: crotch comfort, seat ease, leg width, inseam length
- [ ] Mark changes (pin, chalk) and transfer to pattern

### 7) Waistband
Choose one:
- [ ] **Elastic casing**: fold, stitch casing, leave opening, thread elastic, close opening
- [ ] **Enclosed elastic**: stitch waistband to pants while stretching elastic evenly
- [ ] Add drawstring channel + eyelets (optional)

### 8) Finish hems/cuffs
- [ ] Hem with twin needle/coverstitch/zigzag **or** attach cuffs
- [ ] Press and steam to set stitches

### 9) Final checks
- [ ] Inspect seam elasticity and stress points
- [ ] Trim threads, reinforce pocket corners if needed
- [ ] Wash test and note any adjustments for version 2
