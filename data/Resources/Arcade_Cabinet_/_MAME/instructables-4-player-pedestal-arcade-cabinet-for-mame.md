> Use as reference for designing or building a [[4-Player Pedestal Arcade Cabinet]] for [[MAME]] (layout, woodworking approach, control panel design, wiring/controls).

## What to extract from the guide (when reviewing)
- Cabinet form factor: pedestal vs full upright
- Overall dimensions (width/depth/height)
- Materials list (sheet goods, fasteners, finishes)
- Control panel layout:
  - 4-player spacing
  - Button count per player
  - Start/coin/admin buttons
  - Trackball/spinner support (if included)
- Monitor/TV mounting method
- Access panels (front/back) + serviceability
- Ventilation + cable management
- Electronics:
  - PC specs / OS
  - [[USB Encoder]] model(s)
  - Power distribution / surge protection
- Audio setup (speakers/amp)

## Decisions for my build
- Display choice: [[TV]] vs dedicated arcade monitor
- Control hardware: [[Sanwa]]/[[Happ]] style, encoder approach (e.g., 2× encoders vs 1× multi-input)
- Finish: paint vs laminate/vinyl wrap
- Mobility: casters / leveling feet

## Open questions
- What’s the best control panel angle for comfort at standing height?
- Do I want a detachable control panel for storage/transport?
