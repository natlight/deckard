# Building 2-Player & 4-Player Pedestal Arcade Control Panels (Black MDF, Miters, Pocket Screws, T‑molding, Inserts)

> Video walkthrough of constructing two arcade control panel enclosures (2-player and monster 4-player pedestal) using pre-painted black MDF. Covers accurate miter cuts, pocket-hole joinery with glue, routing a T-molding slot, and precise layout/drilling for joystick/trackball mounting with brass threaded inserts; includes troubleshooting drill-bit sizing for inserts.

## What’s being built
- **Two control panels**:
  - A **smaller 2-player control panel** for a full-size 2-player cabinet.
  - A **“monster” 4-player pedestal control panel**.
- Material: **high-quality pre-painted black MDF** (protective foil removed before cutting).

> [!INFO] Key theme
> Because the MDF is pre-finished, accuracy matters more: fewer mistakes means less sanding/filling and a cleaner final look.

## Workflow overview (high level)
- Print/design sketches with **all dimensions and miters** before cutting.
- Sort panels, confirm orientation (front/back, button areas, etc.).
- Cut miters (mostly **45°**) on the table saw; verify with an angle finder.
- Dry-fit with painter’s tape; correct any small miter mismatch with a disk sander.
- Assemble using **pocket screws + glue**.
- Route **T-molding slot** in the top.
- Mark and drill control layout (joysticks/trackball).
- Install **brass threaded inserts** for mounting hardware.

## Materials & tools mentioned
- Pre-painted **black MDF** (19 mm thickness mentioned for pocket-hole settings).
- Table saw + angle finder.
- Disk sander (for micro-adjusting miter fit).
- Painter’s tape (for temporary assembly/alignment).
- **Kreg** pocket-hole jig (depth set to material thickness).
- Glue + pocket screws.
- Router (for T-molding slot; test cut first).
- Drill bits + drill stop.
- Brass inserts + driver bit for slow insertion.

## Cutting & fit-up notes
- Miters are cut and checked; an angle of about **45.7°** is considered acceptable in context.
- When a taped dry-fit shows a small mismatch:
  - Use a **disk sander** to remove a tiny amount and bring the joint “spot on.”

## Pocket-hole joinery (Kreg)
- Pocket holes are laid out along edges where panels join.
- Jig setup:
  - Set drilling depth to match **19 mm** material thickness.
  - Test on scrap to ensure the screw **does not break through**.

> [!INFO] Adhesion on pre-painted MDF
> Lightly sand glue surfaces to improve glue bond.

## Routing the T-molding slot
- Route the slot in the control panel top.
- Do a **test piece** first to confirm depth/center alignment.

## Layout & drilling for controls
- After both control panel enclosures are built, remaining work:
  - **Mark** joystick hole locations on the top.
  - **Drill** holes.
  - Install **brass inserts**.
- Trackball:
  - Fit is checked against the panel; positioned and marked carefully.

## Brass insert issue (drill bit sizing)
- Initial insert fit problem:
  - A bit labeled **5.5 mm** was **not actually 5.5 mm at the tip** (taper meant true diameter only achieved deeper in).
- Fix:
  - Switch to a sharper bit where diameter is consistent.
  - The replacement bit is effectively **~6 mm**, which works after testing.
- Small “dots”/breakthrough points appear on the opposite side due to the bit’s point:
  - Not considered an issue; later sanding + thick vinyl overlay will hide it.

> [!WARNING] Takeaway
> Verify drill-bit diameter and geometry (especially tapered bits) with a test hole before drilling all insert locations.

## Process checklist (replicable)
- [ ] Draft/print cut list + miter angles.
- [ ] Remove protective foil; label parts and orientation.
- [ ] Cut 45° miters; verify with angle finder.
- [ ] Tape dry-fit; sand miters if needed.
- [ ] Mark pocket-hole locations.
- [ ] Set pocket jig depth to material thickness; test on scrap.
- [ ] Sand glue surfaces (pre-painted MDF).
- [ ] Glue + pocket screw assembly.
- [ ] Route T-molding slot (test first).
- [ ] Mark joystick/trackball locations.
- [ ] Drill pilot/insert holes with correct bit; test fit inserts.
- [ ] Install brass inserts at low speed.

## What’s next (per video)
- Next video will build:
  - The **pedestal base**.
  - The **2-player cabinet** itself.
